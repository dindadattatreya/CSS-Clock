	    <title>CSS Clock</title> CSS Clock will appear on browser tab
	    <style> starts a css code block
	        /* Base styling for the clock */ this is a comment in code
	        .clock { style of the container of main clock
	            position: relative; it defines 2 things, 1st is its position becomes relative and 2nd it allows positioning child elements in the clock div or the container
	            width: 200px;
	            height: 200px; it makes resolution of the clock size to 200x200 pixels
	            border: 10px solid #333; 10px means 10 pixel wide border around the clock and solid #333 means a solid black color
	            border-radius: 50%; it makes the clock circular, cause 50% means it cuts 50% from the corners of a square so, it makes a circular shape
	            background: #fff; white background color
	            margin: 20px auto; auto means it centers the clock horizontally and 20px margin means adding 20 pixel of margin above
	        }
	
	        .clock .center { code for the small dot in center
	            position: absolute; positioning it in container (clock)
	            width: 12px;
	            height: 12px; size of dot
	            background: #333; dark gray color
	            border-radius: 50%; circular shape
	            top: 50%; 
	            left: 50%; positions the dot at the exact center
	            transform: translate(-50%, -50%); adjustment of width and height for perfectly center
	            z-index: 10; 3d effect but as of now, it is above the clock hands
	        }
	
	        /* Styling for the clock hands */
	        .clock .hand { a common code for hour, minute, second 
	            position: absolute; precisely positioned
	            top: 50%;
	            left: 50%; at the center of clock
	            transform-origin: center bottom; important cause this line sets the point of rotation for clock hands
	            transform: translate(-50%, -100%) rotate(90deg); centers the hands horizontally and positions them vertically so they extend upward from the center.
	            transition: all 0.05s ease-in-out; simple animation css
	        }
	
	        .hour {
	            width: 8px;
	            height: 50px;
	            background: #333;
	            z-index: 3; it appears above others
	        } pretty self explanatory
	
	        .minute {
	            width: 6px;
	            height: 70px;
	            background: #333;
	            z-index: 2; it appears below hour hand
	        } pretty self explanatory
	
	        .second {
	            width: 2px;
	            height: 90px;
	            background: red;
	            z-index: 1; it appears last 
	        } pretty self explanatory
	    </style>
	</head>
	 always remember css code will be always under head tag and we used internal css technique, there are also two ways to do css, externally and inline css.
	<body>
	    <div class="clock">
	        <div class="center"></div>
	        <div class="hand hour" id="hour"></div>
	        <div class="hand minute" id="minute"></div>
	        <div class="hand second" id="second"></div>
	    </div>
	divisions. thats it. nothing more, it just creates spaces, actually it does a lot more than that but i can't teach you now, better to google
	    <script> javascript starts
	        function updateClock() {  Defines a function to update the clock
	            const now = new Date(); fetching current date and time
	            const seconds = now.getSeconds(); the current seconds (0â€“59).
	            const minutes = now.getMinutes(); the current minutes (0â€“59).
	            const hours = now.getHours(); he current hour (0-23)
	btw const means constant variables and these "now", "seconds", "minutes" and "hours" are just names of these variables like we did it in maths "let x be the time ronaldo jerk off by seeing messi"
	            const secondDeg = seconds * 6; it is converting seconds to degrees by using this formula, 360 degrees / 60 seconds,  (360Â° Ã· 60 = 6Â° per second). 
	            const minuteDeg = minutes * 6 + seconds * 0.1; same way to convert minutes to degrees, 6 degrees / minute + offset
	            const hourDeg = hours * 30 + minutes * 0.5; again same way to convert seconds to degrees, 30 degrees / hour + offset
	also again secondDeg, minuteDeg and hourDeg are just name of these const variables
	
	            document.getElementById("second").style.transform = `translate(-50%, -100%) rotate(${secondDeg}deg)`;
	            document.getElementById("minute").style.transform = `translate(-50%, -100%) rotate(${minuteDeg}deg)`;
	            document.getElementById("hour").style.transform = `translate(-50%, -100%) rotate(${hourDeg}deg)`;
	        }
	these 3 lines are the backbone, so please give attention-
	Selects an element by its ID (second, minute, or hour), which represents each clock hand.
	Applies a transform style to position and rotate each hand.
	
	The transform property has two parts: translate(-50%, -100%) and rotate(...).
		This translate part ensures that each clock hand starts from the center of the clock:
	
		translate(-50%, -100%): Adjusts the position of the hand.
			translate(-50%, -100%) centers the clock hand horizontally and vertically from the starting point. Hereâ€™s what each value does:
		-	50% (horizontal): Moves the hand left by 50% of its own width, centering it horizontally.
		-	100% (vertical): Moves the hand upward by 100% of its height, so the hand extends from the center upward, like an actual clock hand. This centering effect allows the rotate portion to pivot each hand correctly from the bottom center point.
	
	The rotate function turns the hand to the correct angle based on the current time.
		Each clock hand has a calculated angle (secondDeg, minuteDeg, hourDeg), representing the rotation in degrees:
	
		${secondDeg}deg: The rotation angle for the second hand. secondDeg is calculated as seconds * 6, where each second adds 6 degrees (since 360Â° Ã· 60 seconds = 6Â°).
		${minuteDeg}deg: The rotation angle for the minute hand, which combines the minutes and seconds for gradual movement.
		${hourDeg}deg: The rotation angle for the hour hand, which combines the hour and minute values for gradual movement.
	document.getElementById("second").style.transform = ... rotates the second hand to point to the correct second.
	document.getElementById("minute").style.transform = ... rotates the minute hand to point to the correct minute.
	document.getElementById("hour").style.transform = ... rotates the hour hand to point to the correct hour.
	
	        setInterval(updateClock, 1000); Calls updateClock() every 1000 milliseconds = 1 second.
	        updateClock(); Initial call to set correct time on load
	    </script> script js ends here
	</body> body end
	
	</html> basically saying good bye :)
